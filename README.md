## Assignment
Assignment 1: Classes, Encapsulation and Unit Test Planning. This assignment involves creating basic classes that will be part of a larger system. These classes will focus on using concepts from Module 01, especially encapsulation. This means that important information will be kept private within the class, and only accessed or changed using specific public methods called accessors and setters mutators.

## Encapsulation
[use this section to explain how Encapsulation was achieved in the BankAccount and Transaction classes.]
